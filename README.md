## Framerate Limit
You must set the FPS field to `0` in Forknife, if you want to have a **Unlimited** framerate limit in Fortnite.

## Notice
* You may also need to set a custom resolution in your Nvidia or AMD Control Panel for Forknife to work.
* Forknife can set the read-only attribute on the configuration file. It is on by default, however, you will not be allowed to save changes in your Fortnite Settings while it is on. If it is off, Fortnite **may** overwrite your custom settings when you update the game.
