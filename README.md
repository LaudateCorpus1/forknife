## Getting Started
1. Download and install the GTK+ for Windows Runtime Environment from [forknife.zip](https://github.com/braycarlson/forknife/releases/download/0.1/forknife.zip) or download it separately [here](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases).
2. Open `gtk3-runtime-3.24.10-2019-08-05-ts-win64.exe`, click `Next` > `I Agree` > `Next` and ensure `Set up PATH environment variable to include GTK+ (recommended)` is checked, and click `Next` and install it wherever you prefer.
3. Delete `gtk3-runtime-3.24.10-2019-08-05-ts-win64.exe`
4. Run `forknife.exe`.

## Note
* Please ensure you have launched **Fortnite** at least once, and allowed the game to automatically detect the best settings or have saved custom settings in-game before running Forknife.
* You need to set a custom resolution in your Nvidia or AMD Control Panel as well as in Forknife to use a custom resolution in Fortnite.
* Forknife can set/unset the read-only attribute for the Fortnite configuration file. It is set by default, however, you will not be allowed to make changes to settings in-game while it is set. If it is unset, Fortnite **may** overwrite your custom settings when you update the game.
* You must set the FPS field to `0` in Forknife, if you want to have a **Unlimited** framerate in Fortnite.
